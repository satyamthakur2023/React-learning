# 🌟 My React Learning Journey & Demo Portfolio

Welcome to my **React Portfolio Project**! This repository documents the beginning of my journey into React development, where I explore how to build reusable components, manage application structure, and eventually grow into a **full-stack developer**.

---

## 🚀 Why React?

React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building modern, scalable web applications. Learning React allows me to:

- Understand **component-based architecture**
- Manage **state and props**
- Structure and scale **frontend projects**
- Integrate animations and media
- Set the foundation for **full-stack development**

---

## 📚 What I’ve Learned So Far

✅ **React Components**  
Creating and reusing functional components across the app.

✅ **Props & State**  
Passing data between components and managing internal state.

✅ **Folder Structure & Config**  
Organizing files and using tools like `create-react-app`.

✅ **Styling**  
Applying both inline and external styles to components.

✅ **Third-party Integration**  
Using GSAP for animations, managing images/videos in cards.

---

## 💼 Demo Portfolio Overview

This project includes:

- ✅ A modern **responsive layout**
- ✅ Sections: Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Testimonials, Blog, and Contact
- ✅ Interactive **Card components** for showcasing media (images/videos)
- ✅ **GSAP animations** for scroll effects
- ✅ Modular and clean code organization
